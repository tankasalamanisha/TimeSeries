This repoe will contain projects dealing with TimeSeries datasets. The book that I'm referring to is: Modern Timeseries Forecasting with Python- by Manu Joseph. The aim of this excercise is:
1. Better understand the basics of timeseries data.
2. To learn different forecasting techniques.
3. Diving into Deep Learning aspect of Timeseries forecasting.

## Focus of analysis :
The focus would be to understand plotly visualization techniques, pandas, statsmodels and anomaly detection modules.
